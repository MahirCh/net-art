  <p>"I need to leave. NOW."</p>
  <p>You quickly get your cellphone and put on your shoes. There is not a second to waste. You need to leave immediately.</p>
  <p>The sounds from outside the house get louder.</p>
  <p>You head towards the back door and open it.</p>
  <p>No one in sight.</p>
  <p>You start to make a run towards the woods as the rain continues to pummel in the ground. You desparately attempt to trudge forwards against the mud.</p>
  <p>"What will I do? Where will I go? There is not a house in sight for about six miles or even more."</p>
  <p>As these thoughts fill your head, you slip in the mud, falling face down on the ground.</p>
  <p>You turn your head to see your trail of footprints inprinted in the mud alongside another trail. Except this one is not yours. A shadowy figure looms in front of you, knife in hand.</p>
  <p>It is too late.</p>
