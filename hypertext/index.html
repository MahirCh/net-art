  <p>PLOP!
    You look down at the floor in front of you, as you hear the rain smash against the windows of your room.
    It's dark. Shivers. Sometimes living alone as a college student can be pretty dismal, can't it?
    You get up, heading towards the kitchen when all of a sudden you notice the lights start to flicker
    "Must be a power outage," you think.
    As you begin to walk towards the stove to check the gas, you hear something.
    Thud, thud, thud. 
    Is that footsteps?

    What do you do?
