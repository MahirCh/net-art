  <p>PLOP!</p>
    <p>You look down at the floor in front of you, as you hear the rain smash against the windows of your room.</p>
    <p>
    It's dark. Shivers. Sometimes living alone as a college student can be pretty dismal, can't it?</p>
    <p>You get up, heading towards the kitchen when all of a sudden you notice the lights start to flicker</p>
    <p>"Must be a power outage," you think.</p>
    <p>As you begin to walk towards the stove to check the gas, you hear something.</p>
    <p>Thud, thud, thud. </p>
    <p>Is that footsteps?</p>

    <p>What do you do?</p>
