  <p>"I should call my friend"
    You quickly get out your cellphone and start to dial your friend's number.
    "Come on! Answer!"
    The sounds get closer and closer. It is definitely footsteps.
    No answer.
    You desperately try again as you shiver, hiding against the kitchen cabinets.
    The sounds get closer.
    You turn your head and see a shadowy figure in front of you, knife in hand.
    It is too late.
