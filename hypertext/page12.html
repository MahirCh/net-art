  <p>Your closest friend. He's the masked man. </p>
  <p>You go to get your cellphone and dial the police department's number. With Eric dazed, he would not be able to come back in the house easily. And if he did, you would be able to easily take him down. You can't take the risk of going outside and him taking you by surprise.</p>
  <p>"Hello, this is Marydale Police Department."</p>
  <p>"Hello? I need help. There is an intruder at my house. 345 Treehouse Lane. Please send help, NOW!"</p>
  <p>"We are sending a police car now. Please stay in a safe place. Is he still in the house?"</p>
  <p>You check back outside your room as you see the main door still open. No sign of the intruder.</p>
  <p>"No. He ran outside. Listen, there's no house here within a six mile radius. I need help immediately."</p>
