  <p>"I need to stay put here. I have the advantage of awareness here."</p>
  <p>The sounds get louder and continue for the next five minutes. As if something is being dragged against the patio floor.</p>
  <p>Finally you see something pop in through the doorway again. It's him.</p>
  <p>You're crouched behind the living room sofa, and he can't see you. He looks around, evidently searching for you.</p>
  <p>"WHERE ARE YOU"</p>
  <p>Wait... that is not Eric's voice.</p>
  <p>"WHERE IS MY MEAL"</p>
  <p>His tone changes, becoming amused. "I crave meat"</p>
  <p>You start to shudder behind the sofa, but you realize that the intruder is still visibly dazed by your attack. He is staggering like a drunk.</p>
  <p>His footsteps grow closer and you decide it is time. You lunge at him again with your bat, striking him this time on his knee. He falls to the ground dropping his knife as you continue to beat him with your bat</p>
  <p>You hear a siren from the distance grow closer to your house and you breathe a sigh of relief</p>
  <p>"I'm saved..."</p>
  <p>A police officer walks in the front door.</p>

  <p>One hour later...</p>
  <p>Eric sits in your living room, shuddering under a blanket with wet hair</p>
  <p>"I can't even imagine what would have happened to me, Harry. He saw you were the closest contact to me at the time through the FindMy app. If you didn't think fast enough, I may have still been in his van, going to God knows where"</p>
  <p>You smile. As you look at your phone, you think of someone else to call. This time, not the police. You pick up the phone and give it a ring.</p>
  <p>"Hello? Hi Dad. It's Harry."</p>
  
  <p>The end.</p>
