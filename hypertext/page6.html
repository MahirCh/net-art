  <p>"Maybe if I stay in place I will be safe"
    You stay crouched next to the kitchen cabinets, waiting desperately for the sounds to go away.
    Hoping for nothing to happen. Hoping that this is all just a dream.
    "How I wish I had not yelled at my parents"
    Tears swell in your eyes as you remember what took place two years ago. Two years ago and no contact.
    Despite all their attempts to reach out to you.
    You start to shiver, not just from the cold.
    Thud. Thud. Thud. The footsteps get closer.
    You turn your head to see the shine of a knife.

    It is too late.
