  <p>"I need to confront who this is."</p>
  <p>You straighten your back, annoyed that there would be someone outside in the rain at this time and in this weather.</p>
  <p>"Who is there?"</p>
  <p>You see a sudden movement through the window.</p>
  <p>Whoever it is doesn't seem to want to answer.</p>
  <p>"This isn't a normal person..."</p>
  <p>You head back towards the kitchen to grab a knife, but as you turn your head, you see another knife.</p>
  <p>Except this one is not yours... and it is in the hands of someone else.</p>
  <p>It is too late.</p>
