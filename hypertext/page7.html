  <p>"I need to confront who this is."
    You straighten your back, annoyed that there would be someone outside in the rain at this time and in this weather.
    "Who is there?"
    You see a sudden movement through the window.
    Whoever it is doesn't seem to want to answer.
    "This isn't a normal person..."
    You head back towards the kitchen to grab a knife but as you turn your head you see another knife. 
    Except this one is not yours... and it is in the hands of someone else.

    It is too late.
