  <p>"I need to save Eric."</p>
  <p>You run after the intruder, ready to save your friend. </p>
  <p>As you run out the door, you look around. Left. Right. In front. He's nowhere in sight. Where did he go?</p>
  <p>You walk down your patio steps, when all of a sudden your feet get stuck. Something is holding them.</p>
  <p>You look underneath you and you see the intruder under your patio, with bloodshot eyes ready to pounce at you.</p>
  <p>He slashes his knife across your feet as you cry in agony and then takes you down with him.</p>
  <p>"You shouldn't have come out. We are going to have some fun together."</p>
