  <h1>The noise...</h1>
  <p><i>"Maybe if I stay in place I will be safe."</i></p>
  <p>You stay crouched next to the kitchen cabinets, waiting desperately for the sounds to go away.</p>
  <p>Hoping for nothing to happen. Hoping that this is all just a dream.</p>
  <p><i>"How I wish I had not yelled at my parents."</i></p>
  <p>Tears swell in your eyes as you remember what took place two years ago. Two years ago and no contact.</p>
  <p>Despite all their attempts to reach out to you.</p>
  <p>You start to shiver, not just from the cold.</p>
  <p>Thud. Thud. Thud. The footsteps get closer.</p>
  <p>You turn your head to see the shine of a knife.</p>
  <p style="color: crimson;"><u>It is too late.</u></p>
