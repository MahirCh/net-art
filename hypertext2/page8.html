  <h1>The noise...</h1>
  <p><i>"I need to arm myself."</i></p>
  <p>You crouch down and head towards your closet to get your baseball bat.
  <p>You see a sudden movement through the window.</p>
  <p>Whoever it is doesn't seem to want to have a normal conversation.</p>
  <p><i>"This isn't a normal person..."</i></p>
  <p>You stay put with your metal baseball bat in hand, ready to take on anyone that comes in the room.</p>
  <p>CREAK! The sound of the main door creeping open echoes throughout the empty house. He's inside.</p>
  <p>You creep towards the doorframe to get a good look at the intruder. You can't see any details in the darkness of the night. His face is covered with a white mask and he is wearing all black.</p>
  <p><i>"I knew something was wrong."</i></p>
  <p>"Yeah, I told you something was wrong!"</p>
  <p>Your dad is driving you as you sit in the passenger seat.</p>
  <p>"How many times have I told you, Harry? How many times do I have to tell you to not hang around with the wrong croud!"</p>
  <p>"But Dad!"</p>
  <p>"No buts! Do you not know that these friends of yours can get you in trouble? You are 16!"</p>
  <p>You notice a tear coming out of your eyes and wipe it from your face.</p>
  <p><i>"How I wish Dad were here today"</i></p>
  <p>You snap back to the present and notice the intruder walking through the house, checking the rooms, knife in hand. As he checks the living room you notice his back is facing you.</p>
  <p>"This is my chance"</p>
  <p>SMACK!</p>
  <p>You charge at the intrduer, hitting the intruder in the head with your bat. Dazed, he drops the knife and hurries towards the exit, dropping something else in the process.</p>
  <p>You make your way to what he dropped and realize it's a phone. You pick it up and turn it on, only to almost drop it in shock.</p>
  <p>The homescreen. It is your friend.</p>
  <p style="color: tomato;""><u>Eric.</u></p>
