  <h1>The noise...</h1>
  <p><i>"I need to stay put here. I have the advantage of awareness here."</i></p>
  <p>The sounds get louder and continue for the next five minutes. As if something is being dragged against the patio floor.</p>
  <p>Finally you see something pop in through the doorway again. It's him.</p>
  <p>You're crouched behind the living room sofa, and he can't see you. He looks around, evidently searching for you.</p>
  <p style="color: tomato;"">"Come out now, little boy.."</p>
  <p>Wait... that is not Eric's voice.</p>
  <p>His tone changes, becoming amused. <span style="color: tomato;"">"You sure can run... but you can't hide"</span></p>
  <p>You start to shudder behind the sofa, but you realize that the intruder is still visibly dazed by your attack. He is staggering like a drunk.</p>
  <p>His footsteps grow closer and you decide it is time. You lunge at him again with your bat.</p>
