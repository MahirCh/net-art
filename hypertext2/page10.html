  <h1>The noise...</h1>
  <p><i>"I need to get him. NOW."</i></p>
  <p>You quickly put on your shoes. There is not a second to waste. You need to charge at him.</p>
  <p>The sounds from outside the house get louder.</p>
  <p>You head towards the front door and open it.</p>
  <p>You can see the intruder, dressed in fully black clothing with a black mask covering his face. He's about 20 feet away. And he is facing you.</p>
  <p>You charge towards the intruder, ready to tackle him to the ground.</p>
  <p>It is meaningless. He is too big for you and far stronger. He stops your charge and picks you up, only to slam you against the patio steps.</p>
  <p>You groan as the pain ripples from your back throughout your body. You attempt to move, but you can't. You are in agony and remain still, motionless.</p>
  <p>The man bends down to pick you up and places you on his shoulder. He walks towards the road and continues on the trail for another 10 minutes. You finally reach his white van, and he ties you up and places you in the backseat. There is someone else lying down there as well, but you cannot tell who it is.</p>
  <p>You finally hear the man speak.</p>
  <p style="color: crimson;"><u>"Don't you worry," he snickers. "Your new home will be much better"</u></p>
