  <p><i>"I should check out what that is."</i></p>
  <p>You straighten your back, annoyed that there would be some animal outside your house at this time.</p>
  <p>As you walk towards the source of the sound, you notice something—a sudden movement through the window.</p>
  <p>Whoever it is doesn't seem to want to answer.</p>
  <p><i>"This isn't a normal person..."</i></p>
  <p>What do you do?</p>
