    <h1>The noise...</h1>
   <div class="container">
  <p>PLOP!</p>
    <p>You look down at the floor in front of you, as you hear the rain smash against the windows of your room.</p>
    <p>
    It's dark. Shivers. Sometimes living alone as a college student can be pretty dismal, can't it?</p>
    <p>What can be done. It has been years since you have contacted family. You are out here living by yourself, after the incident</p>
    <p>The incident which separated you from your parents whom you were once so close with. Now you live alone in a city with a population of 300 people. Your nearest neighbor is 40 minutes away, by car.</p>
    <p>Sigh. It is not like your family has not tried to contact you either, but ego is one thing...</p>
    <p><i>"Thinking about this won't help me. I better go get something to eat."</i></p>
    <p>You get up, heading towards the kitchen when all of a sudden you notice the lights start to flicker</p>
    <p><i>"Must be a power outage,"</i> you think.</p>
    <p>As you begin to walk towards the stove to check the gas, you hear something.</p>
    <p>Thud, thud, thud. </p>
    <p>Is that footsteps?</p>

    <p>What do you do?</p>
