  <h1>The noise...</h1>
   <div class="container"></div>
  <p><i>"Let's end this."</i></p>
  <p>You run after the intruder, ready to clobber the intruder with your bat. </p>
  <p>As you run out the door, you look around. Left. Right. In front. He's nowhere in sight. Where did he go?</p>
  <p>You walk down your patio steps, when all of a sudden your feet get stuck. Something is holding them.</p>
  <p>You look underneath you and you see the intruder under your patio, with bloodshot eyes ready to pounce at you.</p>
  <p>He slashes his knife across your feet as you cry in agony and then takes you down with him.</p>
  <p style="color: tomato;"">"You shouldn't have come out. We are going to have some fun together."</p>
  <p>Your eyes light up. That voice. <u>It isn't Eric.</u></p>
  <p>You groan as the pain ripples throughout your body. You attempt to move, but you can't. You are in agony and remain still, motionless.</p>
  <p>The man bends down to pick you up and places you on his shoulder. He walks towards the road and continues on the trail for another 10 minutes. You finally reach his white van, and he ties you up and places you in the backseat. There is someone else lying down there as well, but you cannot tell who it is.</p>
  <p style="color: crimson;">"Don't you worry," the man snickers. "Your new home will be much better"</p>
