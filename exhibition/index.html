    <h1>Files Declassified- Life Unprivatized</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Mahir Chaudhry</h2>
    <p>The following three pieces of net art show a choice that many today may perhaps do unknowingly- 
        showing their life online! Today, thousands of people head to social media to share their life with 
        others all across the globe, but did you know that before Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok, some people 
        willingly shared not just silly or educational videos or photos online, but their entire life? 
        These three pieces of net art largely rely on providing viewers with a new “lens” with which 
        they can view information. For instance, iPhone Live provided viewers with a window into the life 
        of Osterhoff, giving them a hint of how he used his phone over the period of a year. Very similarly,
        Syms gave viewers a window into her life by providing them with her three-year period search
        history. Eva and Franco Mattes, like Osterhoff and Syms, too gave viewers a new perspective - they made
        their computer information public to viewers just how it is! Viewers could read, download, and copy
        all data, including bank statements, giving an entirely new sort of openness to the public and letting
        go of privacy that others may hold very dear to!
